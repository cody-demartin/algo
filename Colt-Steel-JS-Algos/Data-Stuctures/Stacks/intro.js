// What is a stack?
//  Define what a stack is
//  Understand what it is

// A stack is an abstract data structure that is a collection of data that 
// follows a LIFO (last in first out) data processing philosophy

// The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from
// the stack

// A stack of plates as it piles up the topmost thing is what gets removed
// the first

// First, last, size
// Used in undo/redo in photoshop/text editors
// History objects in your browser, i.e. routing in React
// Stacks in algorithms
