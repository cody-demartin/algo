// Objectives
//  Define what a Singly Linked List is
//  Compare and contrast them to Arrays
//  Implement insertion, removal and traversal methods on singly linked lists

// What is a linked list?
//  A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property
//  Linked lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null

//   H Length = 3  T
//  [1] -> [2] -> [3]

// Comparisons to arrays
// Lists:
//  Do not have indexes
//  Connected via nodes with a next pointer
//  Random access is not allowed
//   Cannot access nth item immediatly must traverse until nth item and get it

// Arrays:
//  Indexed in order
//  Insertion and deletion can be expensive
//  Can quickly be accessed at a specific index
