//
//  So what is an algorithm?
//      - A process or set of steps to accomplish a certain task
//      - Could be math, could be a suggestion algorithm etc. 
//      - Almost everything in programming involves some sort of algo
//          - Its the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer
//      - Course is interview environments mostly    
//
//  How do you get better at this stuff?
//      - Devise a plan for solving the problems
//          - Strats for breaking it down
//      - Master common problem solving patterns
//
//  Problem solving strat   
//      Understand the Problem
//      Explore concrete examples
//      Break it down 
//      Solve it
